# Assignment the First

## Part 1

1. Be sure to upload your Python script. Provide a link to it here:


| File name                    | label   | Read length | Phred encoding |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| 1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz | Read 1  | 101         | 33             |
| 1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz | Index 1 | 8           | 33             |
| 1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz | Index 2 | 8           | 33             |
| 1294_S1_L008_R4_001.fastq.gz | Read 2  | 101         | 33             |

## Part 2

1. Define the problem
2. Describe output
3. Upload your [4 input FASTQ files](../TEST-input_FASTQ) and your [>=6 expected output FASTQ files](../TEST-output_FASTQ).
4. Pseudocode
5. High level functions. For each function, be sure to include:
   1. Description/doc string
   2. Function headers (name and parameters)
   3. Test examples for individual functions
   4. Return statement

Strategy for Demultiplexing
	•	Initial requirements
	◦	Read1 file is Bio1, Read2 is index1, Read3 is Index2, and Read4 is Bio2
	◦	Each line number in all 4 files line up with the other line # in other files. So entry 8 from file 1 (READ 1), is from the same dna strand as entry 8 from file 4 (READ 4)
	◦	We have 24 indexes that will be the barcodes on the reads, each one of these will need 2 output files, 1 for the read1s and 1 for read2s.
	◦	Need to take the reverse compliment of read3 barcode, and reverse compliment of read4 sequence. For it to line up with first read & barcode
	◦	if the barcodes match within a single paired read, put the two reads into the indexes output files.
	▪	 If both barcodes exist, but don't match, you put in an unmatched file, again with two output file 1 and 2 for the unmatched reads
	▪	For unmatched pairs, write the two indexes   <idx1>-<idx2> at the end of the header for both reads
	▪	If one of the barcodes doesn't exist, put they two reads in the unknown two output files
	▪	For unmatched pairs
	◦	48 index outputs + 2 unmatched outputs + 2 unknown outputs
	◦	STATS output total read-paris that matched, were unmatched, and were unknown
	•	Pseudo code


MAIN
	•	Getargs
	◦	all 4 files of reads
	◦	minimum qual score
	◦	Read length
	◦	Barcode file input
	•	Create dictionary of the swapped pairs possible
	•	Create the sums of the counts of paired, unpaired, unknown
	•	With open all 4 files
	◦	Take 4 lines from each file * store them in lists that are 4 length and named after each read
	▪	Take the reverse compliment of the index3 (with function below)
	▪	See if index 2 and index 3 match and if they both exist
	▪	Take the quality scores of the two indexes
	▪	If either one is below the threshold, then toss em both.
	▪	If they do and match, open output files with the name of the barcode ‘{barcodeName}_r1.fq’   and   ‘{barcodeName}_r2.fq’
	▪	Write to R1 and R2
	▪	The header + indexes ‘<index>-<index>’
	▪	sequences
	▪	Quality scores
	▪	Count matched pairs +1
	▪	Write read 1 to R1, read 2 to R2
	▪	If they both exist but don't match, open the unmatched files: ‘unmatched_R1.fq’   and  ‘unmatched_R2.fq’
	▪	Count to the dictionary of different unmapped pairs
	▪	Write to R1 and R2
	▪	The header + indexes ‘<index>-<index>’
	▪	sequences
	▪	Quality scores
	▪	Count unmatched pairs +1
	▪	If one or both don't exist, open the unknown output files: ‘unknown_R1.fq’    and   ‘unknown_R2.fq’
	▪	Write to R1 and R2
	▪	The header + indexes ‘<index>-<index>’
	▪	sequences
	▪	Quality scores
	▪	Write to R1 and R2
	▪	Count unknown pairs +1
	•	RETURN COUNTS OF mapped, unmapped, unknown, and sorted list of the unmatched pairs that are together

FUNCTIONS
	•	Get args functions
	◦	Bring in the 4 files as 4 inputs
	◦	Read length,
	◦	Minimum quality score
	◦	Barcode file name

	•	Mean Convert fred quality score
	◦	Converts a sequence to a fred quality score

	•	Implement reverse compliment function (takes in dna strand) 
	◦	Returns the reverse compliment 


TEST FILES
	•	Input
	◦	Finished input CHA-CHING
	◦	Have 4 records for each of the 4 read files.
	▪	 Sequences are random valid sequences for each of them
	▪	1 case where the indexes match correctly
	▪	1 case where they are both valid, but don't match
	▪	1 case where one is not valid, should be unknown
	▪	1 case where the quality score is low for one of them (9 mean), even though the barcodes are good and match
	◦	Also have indexes input file that is valid for 2 barcodes
	•	Output
	◦	Need to make output
